<p style="font-family:  'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial,

sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
<b>Definition:</b> The per capita water use controls the forecasted percentage of the amount of water used on a

personal (per capita) basis measured in gallons per capita per day (GPCD). This value alters the total GPCD for

your city, and the region, and includes residential, commercial, and, in many cases, industrial water use divided

among the population.

<br><br>
<b>Real World Example:</b>
There are many ways to reduce our personal water consumption such as installing low-flow toilets and low-flow

shower heads; installing water efficient household appliances, such as new dishwashers and clothes washers; and

reducing water use outdoors by removing turf grass and/or converting to landscapes with low water use plants with

automated irrigation controllers that manage watering schedules efficiently.
<br><br>
In 2010, the mean water consumption for the Phoenix Metropolitan Area was 320 GPCD; the median GPCD was 225. This

indicates broad disparity in the community and household water use across the Valley.

<br><br>

<b>Implementation:</b>
This control reflects the implementation of water policies that reduce personal water consumption and contribute

to a lowered GPCD for the entire city or region. This control varies from 0 to 100%, with 0% equal to a minimum

GPCD (currently set at 70 GPCD; maximum reduction) and 100% equal to the forecasted GPCD for 2085.

   <td>Water budgets for residential water use (water use above a per capita limit regulated), only essential

non-residential water use (hospitals, food production, no potable washing, no grass parks)</td>
