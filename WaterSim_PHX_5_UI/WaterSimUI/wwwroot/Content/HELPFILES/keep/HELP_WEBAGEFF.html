<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
<b>Definition:</b>The efficiency (percentage) of agricultural water use. <br><br>

<b>Real World Examples:</b>
Farmers use various means, some more efficient than others, to irrigate their croplands. Increasing efficiency may allow farmers to increase production of goods per unit of water used (or consumed). Techniques vary greatly, and include:<br><br>

  <tr>
    <td>Center-Pivot</td>
    <td>A type of automated irrigation in which smaller sprinkler nozzles are attached to a larger sprinkler boom. The sprinklers rotate while the system moves on wheels, and is often used to irrigate larger agricultural areas.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Drip</td>
    <td>A planned irrigation system in which water is sent at a low pressure through a perforated pipe or tube. The pipe or tube is typically placed on or below the ground, allowing water to irrigate directly to the root zone of plants. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Flood</td>
    <td>Rather than using an irrigation system, the entire surface of the soil is covered by ponded water. </td>

  <tr>
   <td>Furrow</td>
   <td>Similar to the flood method, except water is applied to rows instead of an entire field. This allows farmers to better control their irrigation system.</td>

   <td>Gravity</td>
   <td>Instead of distributing water through pumping, this type of irrigation allows water to flow by use of only gravity.</td>

  	<td>Rotation</td>
    <td> Crops are irrigated at state intervals with an alloted quanitty of water instead of a continuous rate.</td>

    <td>Sprinkler</td>
    <td>Using pressure, water is sent through perforated pipes or nozzles to spray across an agricultural area.</td>

   <td>A type of wheeled sprinkler system in which a single, large, self-propelled nozzle rotates to irrigate the area.</td>

<b>Implementation:</b>
The scale provided varies from 40% to 100%. A value of 100 represents, for these purposes, the current efficiency of an agricultural water user. A value of 85 (85%) represents a 15% increase in the efficiency of production. i.e., it now takes 85% of the water to produce a similar product as it previously took 100%. Similarily, a value of 70 thus represents a 30% increase in efficiency, and so on.
