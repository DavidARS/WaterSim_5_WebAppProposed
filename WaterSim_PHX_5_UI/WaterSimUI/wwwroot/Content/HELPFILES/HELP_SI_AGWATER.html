<b>The Agriculture Sustainability Indicator</b> represents the amount of agricultural production as a percentage of the 2015 estimate. Since this indicator measures the percent change from 2015, the amount of water needed to produce a <q>generic</q> crop, rather than specific crops, is used. Please note that the value presented represents the 2050 estimate.
<br><br>
The policy control <q>Farm water used by cities</q> removes the number of agricultural acres in production from the calculation, which lowers agricultural production, since water is instead being used for non-agricultural activities. However, agriculture also uses effluent. Thus, the policy control <q>Wastewater Reclaimed</q> effects agricultural production because it alters allocation of effluent from a traditional waste water treatment plant. The effluent will instead be redirected to reclaimed waste water treatment plant to be used for urban purposes.
<br><br>
Presently, agriculture accounts for almost 50% of the total water use in Maricopa County and this vital economic engine remains a cultural identity for many families and communities. Even so, in the future, water currently used for farming and agriculture may instead be used to help meet the water needs of growing communities. Because many agricultural users use Colorado River water as part of their water portfolio, reductions in Colorado River deliveries, as a result of drought or climate change, could reduce production via the number of water credits available for transfer from agriculture to municipal use.
<br><br>
For this simulation, the percentage of surface and groundwater diverted from farms and agriculture to municipal water use ranges from 0 to 100%, with 100% representing all available water being diverted and no water available for agriculture. However, the transfer of water credits would be phased in gradually and complete transfer would not be accomplished until 2085. Keep in mind that even if you set the Farm water used by cities to 100%, agriculture will still receive effluent for irrigation. Thus, production would not go to zero unless the Wastewater Reclaimed policy control is set to 100.
